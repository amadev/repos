repos
=====

Basic operations
----------------

`repos` is a CLI tool that helps to manage multiple git repositories.

Add some repositories with `repos add` command.

  repos add https://review.opendev.org/openstack/nova
  repos add https://review.opendev.org/openstack/cinder

Repository names must be unique. By default the last segment of
repository path used as a name, so conflict could happen.
To overcome, use the `--name` option.

The following basic operations are available.

  repos list
  repos pull

Repositories could be organized hierarchically into groups and
operations can be issued on a particular group only. The most useful
way of using groups is a `search` operation that helps to search on
multiples repositories not depending on a path they were cloned.

  repos search --group qemu needle -- --ignore tests

The search backend could be changed with a 'search_command` config option.

repos sync
----------

A `repos sync` command pulls and pushes repositories to make sure
everything is synchronized. As a pure man dropbox alternative, you can
mark your repo with `auto-commit` tag like `repos add <repo> --tags
auto-commit` and `repos sync` will auto-commit changes in the
repository, pull changes from upstream and push resulting set to
upstream. Surely this may be applied to a specific group only.

Group hierarchy
---------------

With `--group` and `--parent` options, repositories can be easily
organized into a hierarchy.

  repos add --group group-1
  repos add repo-1 --group group-1
  repos add --group group-1.1 --parent group-1
  repos add repo-1.1 --group group-1.1

Group names must be unique. Be careful with circular dependencies.

Config options
--------------

Config by default resided in $HOME/.repos/conf.yaml.

- db: path where `repos` db yaml stored;
- groups: path to group hierarchy symlinks;
- search_command - a template for command, `grep -HRin` by default,
  but `ag -f --search-files` recommended;
- repos_default_directory - all repositories without `--path` specification
  will be cloned here;
- log - path to a log file.

Repository tags
---------------

- auto-commit - for `repos sync` command it will stage all changes and
  commit them;
- shallow - quick clone for big repositories pushing is not planned
  from.

Gerrit repositories download
----------------------------

`repos gerrit <url>` generates a script with `repos` commands to download
all gerrit projects hierarchy.
